# Tiago mask checker
This is a demo application written in Python using rospy for the [Tiago](http://pal-robotics.com/robots/tiago/) from PAL Robotics that can be used at the entrance of enclosed spaces to check if a person is wearing correctly a mask and that their temperature is below a threshold value.
